## Description
Not JATE is a progressive web application text editer that allows users to create and save notes or code snippets both online and offline. Not JATE features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case an option is not supported by a browser. The app can function locally and without an active network connection via an integrated service worker and cache API. 

Future development for this app could include functionality to create categories for separation and organization of saved notes.
